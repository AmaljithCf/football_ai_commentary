And much as our opponents might assume the former merely needs to put on the football pitch and the latter cannot stress this point enough is that they remain one of the most highly regarded institutions in world football.

Yeah can't they just the noisy neighbours are here to stay I think and this one should be close. Everything seemingly on the up at Manchester City choice of managers, the development of the stadium, very good academy for young players as well, very bright on their side of Manchester. Yeah I think they're doing it the right way improving the infrastructure. It's been sound management from the top. Getting bigger and better I'm sure almost every time we come to the Etihad Stadium. A new tear opened relatively recently to increase the capacity and Manchester City enjoying that kind of success that will bring even newer fans to their home. Yeah they've shared some great memories with now a couple of title wins. Some Man City fans might still pine for the days of main road but we're right in the 21st century with this place.
